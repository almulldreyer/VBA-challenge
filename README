# VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street - September 25, 2021

### Background

** I used VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. 

### How I proceeded:

* I created a script that loopd through stocks in 2014, 2015, and 2016 with the following output listed:

  ** Ticker symbol
  ** Yearly change from when stock opened at beginning of year to when stock closed at the end of the year.
  ** Percent Change from opening price at beginning of year to the closing price at the end of the year.
  ** Total stock volume of the stock
  
* As well, I used conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change with red.
